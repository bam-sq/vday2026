    <h1>See you on February 14!</h1>
    <p>Dear Charmaigne, <br /> Thank you so much for saying yes. I was genuinely so worried about asking you out 2 years ago, and now I have the privilege 
	of asking you out again and again. When I look at you, I see my future, a future I want to build with you and spend with you. Ever since I fell in love
	with you, I understood the saying "With love, water is enough. Without love, food does not satisfy." Hindi ko naintindihan yung sinasabi ng magulang ko
	na basta makita lang kaming kumakain, okay na sila. Hindi ko yun naintindihan until nakita kitang kumakain habang pinapanood kita. It wasn't about the food,
	it was about the joy and satisfaction of seeing someone you love enjoy something. I want to keep seeing your smile until I am no longer able to see. I want 
	to hear your laugh until my hearing grows dull. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, not just because I want to, but because I need to. I always
	believed that being dependent on someone else as your "missing half" was stupid. That changed when I met you. Whenever we're together, I feel so full and 
	complete, and the moment you leave, I feel as though my soul has been ripped to shreds. That is a feeling that I no longer want to experience. You complete me.
	That's the truth I preach. I love you. I love you so much it hurts when I'm not with you. I was never like this, baby. You turned me into this kind of person!
	So you have to take responsibility!!!! HEHEHEHEHE HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY BABYYYY!!! I LOVE YOU SO MUCHHHH MWAMWAMWAMWAMWAMWA!!!!</p>
